1. INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

To install this program you can use FreeBSD Ports Collection or untar it
and just make && make install:

	tar vxjf vchkuser-x.x.tar.bz2
	cd vchkuser/
	make
	make install
	make clean

It will install vchkuser on ~vpopmail/bin/ with 4711 modes, owned by vpopmail
user and vchkpw group. It allows any unprivileged process like qmail-smtpd, to
run this program with appropriated privileges.

If you feel very concerned about suid bit programs executable by world, do

	make install-qnofiles

In replacement to

	make install

Like this:

	tar vxjf vchkuser-x.x.tar.bz2
	cd vchkuser/
	make
	make install-qnofiles
	make clean

It will install vchkuser on ~vpopmail/bin/ with 4710 modes, owned by vpopmail
user and qnofiles group, which will restrict this program's execution to users
on qnofiles group, by default only some qmail system users (alias, qmaild,
qmaill and qmailp) including qmaild who runs qmail-smtpd.

2. HOW IT WORKS

vchkuser retrieves REMOTERCPT enviroment variable (usually defined from 
SMTPEXTFORK' patch), checks the configured behavior of vdelivermail looking
for .qmail-default in the domain's VHOME or additional .qamil-<ext> files,
checks if (1) domain exists, (2) user exists or (3) alias exists. If alias
do not exist and (1) or (2) do not exist, returns BOUNCE code, if (3) or
(1) and (2) exists, returns NOTBOUNCE code. BOUNCE and NOTBOUNCE are defined
in vchkuser.h.

If domain's behavior is not 'bounce-no-mailbox' vchkuser assumes special 
behavior configured by sysadmin and bypasses its verification, returning
NOTBOUNCE code.

If anything unexpected happens, vchkuser returns FAIL code.

This version of vchkuser is expected to be used with qmail-smtpd's SMTPEXTFORK
patch, which will fork this program and take a decision upon the return code
of vchkuser. It means vchkuser is expected to be run as a child proccess of
qmail-smtpd.

3. USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Once installed, be sure qmail-smtpd.c's SMTPEXTFORK patch was applied in
your running version of qmail-smtpd.

Add /usr/local/vpopmail/bin/vchkuser to the appropriated enviroment variable:

	echo /usr/local/vpopmail/bin/vchkuser > /var/service/smtpd/env/SMTPEXTFORK

Or use it with tcprules:

	:allow,SMTPEXTFORK="/usr/local/vpopmail/bin/vchkuser"

Remember that more than one program can be used with SMTPEXTFORK patch. If
you already use any other, add vchkuser separated by comma:

	:allow,SMTPEXTFORK="/usr/local/vpopmail/bin/vchkuser,/some/other/prog"

Or

	echo "/some/other/prog,/usr/local/vpopmail/bin/vchkuser" \
		> /var/service/smtpd/env/SMTPEXTFORK

Restart qmail-smtpd service with svc -k /var/service/smtpd or your
own way.

4. GOOD LUCK

1. Install Instructions for Soft Fail Greylisting System for Qmail

Please, before you continue, note that this software depends on SMTPEXTFORK
patch applied to your qmail-smtpd. Those patches are maintained both for
qmail with Erwin Hoffman's SpamControl system and Andre Opperman's qmail-LDAP.

2. Understanding How Soft Fail Works

Soft Fail works with a database. In this version the only database available
is MySQL. It is planned to add Berkeley DB support in the future.

When an SMTP session starts, softfail is expected to be forked from
qmail-smtpd - this is why you need SMTPEXTFORK. When forked, this processes
gets all enviroment variables which were available for the parent process
(qmail-smtpd), simply because this is how Unix is. Soft Fail will check
in the database if that triplet (TCPREMOTEIP, REMOTEMF and REMOTERCPT) is
already known. If not, will return ENVELOPE_SOFTFAIL_CODE exit code. By
default ENVELOPE_SOFTFAIL_CODE is 101, and qmail-smtpd's SMTPEXTFORK patch
will issue the apropriate and customizable SMTP temporary failure code.

If the incoming message is from a mailing list, REMOTEMF will be silently
ignored from Soft Fail's check to avoid know problems with Yahoo Groups and
a few other similar systems. Soft Fail will exit ENVELOPE_SOFTFAIL_CODE 
every time the message tries to be reinjected, for UNBLOCK_AFTER_SEEN
seconds.

If a message is to be delivered again (thus, the remote SMTP system know how
to behave upon SMTP temporary failure, this is good) after UNBLOCK_AFTER_SEEN
seconds, Soft Fail exits 0 which tells SMTPEXTFORK to continue processing
the message as usual. Soft Fail for this situation has finished it's duties.
But not before adding the unique message ID to the database. This message id
will be verified if the same TCPREMOTEIP address tries to deliver more than
one message.

In fact Soft Fail has a white listing feature, so, if a certain IP address
or domain is in the white list, Soft Fail will exit 0 without extra checks.
Soft Fail also has a black listing feature. Those checks are made at the
same time, and it allows Soft Fail to make a decision of accepting the
message or not without further checks.

If the remote host is trying to delivery the message again, before
UNBLOCK_AFTER_SEEN seconds has passed, Soft Fail will check if the last
delivery trial was before RFCSEENTIME. According to some RFC's an SMTP
MTA should not try to delivery the same message again before 90 seconds.
This behavior may be artificially broken for example, if the remote MTA
administrator issue a queue reprocessing command (like, sending ALRM signal
to qmail-send). So, we have a tolerance on the number of times a remote
MTA is allowed to try redelivering the same message again before RFCSEENTIME
seconds. This tolerance is SEENCONSECMAXTIME consecutive times.

If the message reinjection happens before RFCSEENTIME for SEENCONSECMAXTIME
consecutive times, Soft Fail acts as a Greylisting decision maker, moving the
remote MTA's TCPREMOTEIP from the grey list to the black list. It automatically
adds TCPREMOTEIP to the database as Blacklisted.

Run-time configuration defined by enviroment variables may overwrite the 
mentioned defined values, according to the table:

define			enviroment
------------------	---------------
RFCSEENTIME		SFSEENTIME
SEENCONSECMAXTIME	SFMAXSEENTIMES
UNBLOCK_AFTER_SEEN	SFGLTIME

Everytime a message is tried to be delivered, Soft Fail first checks for the
existance of the TCPREMOTEIP or REMOTEMF in the white or black lists. If they
do exist in the black list, Soft Fail exits ENVELOPE_REJECT_CODE, which,
by default is 100. qmail-smtpd's SMTPEXTFORK patch will issue the appropriated
permanent failure code in the SMTP session, along with a customizable message.
Soft Fail also increments in one the counter of number of times that TCPREMOTEIP
has been rejected, for statistics purposes.

If a entry exists for over EXPIRE_SEENMSG minutes in the database, but the
message was never accepted, Soft Fail will remove it from db.

The accepted message will only be in the white list for the combination of
triplet+msg-id for EXPIRE_ACCEPTED days. After that, the record will expire
and get removed from db.

There is and additional and optional program that comes with Soft Fail. It
is the rotate-softfail-db program, responsible for database maintainance.
This program removes every blacklisted entry from the database if the entry
exists for more than MAXDAYSAUTOBLACKINDB days and only if the entry was
added automatically.

Also, rotate-softfail-db allows you to delete only auto blacklisted or all
entries (blacklisted, greylisted and whitelisted), by using the program
with the -b or -f options, respectively.

Whitelisted or blacklisted entries added manually will stay permanently in the
database. Soft Fail or rotate-softfail-db will never delete manual entries
from db. You should manage manual entries by yourself.

3. Installing Soft Fail

Edit softfail.h and set those constants to the value you wish, according to
desired bevior of Soft Fail, described in (2). Default values are appropriated
for the average use.

At least, conf.h and set the database information. Create the necessary
user in your database or just edit database.sql with the same db information
provided on conf.h.

Run
	$ mysql -uroot -p < softfail.sql

MySQL will prompt for the root password and run all SQL queries from
softfail.sql.

Edit rotate-softfail.sh and add the appropriated e-mail address to the
MAILREPORT variable in this shell script. It will generate a report of
Soft Fail's activies based on its log file.

Build and compile the programs:

	$ make
	# make install

Optionally, add the recomended crontab entries:

	# make crontab-entry

It will add the following entries to /etc/crontab:

 # Soft Fail daily maintainance
 @daily		root	/usr/local/bin/rotate-softfail-db
 @daily		root	/usr/local/bin/rotate-softfail.sh

You are done with Soft Fail.

4. Configure Soft Fail usage on qmail-smtpd's SMTPEXTFORK patch:

Add /var/qmail/bin/softfail to the appropriated enviroment variable:

	# echo /var/qmail/bin/softfail > /var/service/smtpd/env/SMTPEXTFORK

Or use it with tcprules:

	:allow,SMTPEXTFORK="/var/qmail/bin/softfail"

Remember that more than one program can be used with SMTPEXTFORK patch. If
you already use any other, add softfail separated by comma:

	:allow,SMTPEXTFORK="/var/qmail/bin/softfail,/some/other/prog"

Or

	# echo "/some/other/prog,/var/qmail/bin/softfail" \
		> /var/service/smtpd/env/SMTPEXTFORK

Restart qmail-smtpd service with svc -k /var/service/smtpd or your
own way.

If you want to customize SMTP failure messages, according to SMTPEXTFORK's
patch specifications you can set the 454SMTPEXTFORK and 554SMTPEXTFORK
enviroment variables. Example:

	# echo "temporary failure, softfail policy (greylisting)" \
		> /service/smtpd/env/454SMTPEXTFORK

	# echo "permanent failure, softfail policy (greylisting)" \
		> /service/smtpd/env/554SMTPEXTFORK

Optionally, customize RFC Blacklisting metrics:

	# echo 60 > /service/smtpd/env/SFSEENTIME
	# echo 12 > /service/smtpd/env/SFMAXSEENTIMES

Which will make SoftFail add any IP to blacklist if trying to delivery
SFMAXSEENTIMES consecutive times the same messages in less than SFSEENTIME
seconds.

If you want to modify the Greylisting time, for example, to 1 minute (60s):

        # echo 60 > /service/smtpd/env/SFGLTIME

Which will cause temporary failure for only SFGLTIME seconds.

If you want to activate META-SPF check you have the SFSPFBEHAVIOR environment
variable (SoftFail SPF Behavior). If this env var is set, Soft Fail will never
run for domains which Sender Policy Framework (SPF) resolves to PASS. Any value
will do, but the suggested value right now is "5". 

	# echo 5 > /service/smtpd/env/SFSPFBEHAVIOR

5. Following Soft Fail's behavior

Soft Fail has its own log file, /var/log/softfail.log. You can check it
to see softfail in action. The logs are formatted this way:

softfail: REMOTEMF -> REMOTERCPT (TCPREMOTEIP) <Additional Information>

<Additional Information> is usually similar to:

 - Doesn't Exists Block (6m)
 - Exists Block id = 18
 - Exists Accept id = 16
 - Exists Block id = 13  (RFC note: seen IP again (0/10) too early)
 - Exists Block id = 2367697 (RFC note: seen too early for (10/10) times: Blacklisted)

They give you all necessary information regarding Soft Fail's decisions as
described in (2).

6. Maintainance programs

You will also have installed the following maintainance programs:
		
- /usr/local/bin/rotate-softfail-db

It is a C program that, without arguments (this is how it is run from crontab)
will delete all auto blacklisted entries from your database (the ones
blacklisted automatically) that are older than MAXDAYSAUTOBLACKINDB days.

If used with the -b option, this program will delete all AUTO *blacklisted*
entries from your database, doesn't matter how long they exist.

If used with -f option, this program will delete all AUTO entries from
softfail's database, doesn't matter how long they exist or if they are
black, grey or whitelisted.

MANUAL database entries should only be handled by yourself in the SQL db.

- /usr/local/bin/rotate-softfail.sh

This is a simple shell scripts which sends some softfail's statistics from
e-mail. You are STRONGLY SUGGESTED to change MAILREPORT address in this file.

7. Good Luck!

Good Luck with Soft Fail, an enhaced greylisting system for Qmail used and
approved by a number of FreeBSD Brasil LTDA's customers.

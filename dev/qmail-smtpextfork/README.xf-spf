1. Install Instructions for External Forked SPF Checker System for Qmail

Please, before you continue, note that this software depends on SMTPEXTFORK
patch applied to your qmail-smtpd. Those patches are maintained both for
qmail with Erwin Hoffman's SpamControl system and Andre Opperman's qmail-LDAP.

2. Understanding How xf-spf Works

When an SMTP session starts, xf-spf is expected to be forked from
qmail-smtpd - this is why you need SMTPEXTFORK. When forked, this processes
gets all enviroment variables which were available for the parent process
(qmail-smtpd).

When forked, xf-spf will use TCPREMOTEIP, REMOTEMF, REMOTERCPT and REMOTEHELO
enviroment vars. The first one is set by tcpserver(1) and the last three are
set my SMTPEXTFORK patch; xf-spf will them use libspf2 to perform the SPF
check and validate the sender according to RFC-4408.

The enviroment var, SPFBEHAVIOR needs to be set. If it is not set, xf-spf
will not run, and will log a message stating SPFBEHAVIOR enviroment var
is not available. SPFBEHAVIOR will define the proper behavior of xf-spf.

Similar to the excellent Saout's SPF implementation for qmail, SPFBEHAVIOR
may be set with values from 0 to 6. If SPFBEHAVIOR is not set, xf-spf will
not run at all, and will return code XFPASS imediately, (this code is defined
in xf-spf.h) which will make qmail-smtpd with SMTPEXTFORK's patch accept
the message.

If SPFBEHAVIOR is not set, you are supposed not to run xf-spf at all.

If you want to disable xf-spf for some reason, or disable it's checking for
one particular IP address, using tcprules(1), set SPFBEHAVIOR to 0.

The following values and behavior are supported by xf-spf:

	0: xf-spf will never do SPF lookups, will not generate log, and will
	   return XFPASS code imediately;

	1: xf-spf will do SPF lookups but will only syslog the results;

	2: return XFPASS code upon lookup failure's caused by libspf DNS
	   lookup problems;
	
	3: Rejects all mail when SPF lookup resolves to fail - when sender is
	   not allowed per SPF policy - this is the minimum recommended choice;

	4: Rejects all mail when SPF lookup resolves to softfail - when sender
	   is not designated as permitted but domain's SPF policy is '~all';

	5: Rejects all mail when SPF lookup resolves to neutral - when sender
	   is not designated as permitted but domain's SPF policy is '?all';

	6: Rejects all mail when SPF lookup does not resolve to pass - when
	   sender is not designated as permitted or domain does not have SPF
	   record, or upon any temporary or permanent failure caused by libspf2,
	   by xf-spf or by local DNS problems. This is the most aggressive
	   policy and is not recommended untill SPF is not widely spread, because
	   xf-spf will always reject messages from domains which do not have SPF
	   record - and they are many.

Those definitions are recursive. Which means that '2' includes 1 and 2; 3 includes
1, 2 and 3, and 6 means all behavior from 1-6.

According to SPFBEHAVIOR's value, xf-spf will return XFPASS or XFPERMF code.
The second one will make qmail-smtpd return a 550 message. It is suggested 
that you customize this message - SMTPEXTFORK allows you to do this. If libspf2
fails for some reason, it will be logged via syslog and XFSPFERR code will be
returned.

This SPF checker implementation does not rewrite the message adding the known
Received-SPF: header. RFC-4008 says it is recommended but not "a must". So we
only do logging of this entry.

3. Logging

xf-spf logs via syslog; it uses LOG_INFO on LOG_MAIL, so mail.info should point
somewhere in your system to get xf-spf's logging; FreeBSD system's and most 
Unix or Unix-like systems log mail.info to /var/log/maillog. What xf-spf logs:

	- Complete Received-SPF entries for SPF lookups on domains that do have
	  the appropriated SPF DNS records;

	- Optionally, Received-SPF entry for domains which do not have SPF DNS
	  record. This is NOT the default xf-spf behavior. If you want this
	  sort of logging to happen, edit xf-spf.h and define LOGNSPFDOM to 1
	  before building this program;

	- Invalid HELO/EHLO, invalid FROM envelope sender, invalid IP address,
	  invalid domain or user (invalid characters) and every other error
	  libspf2 may point us;

	- If SMTPBEAVIOR enviroment var is not defined.


4. Installing xf-spf

Installing xf-spf is easy. You can do it from FreeBSD Ports Collection, or
you can just untar, make and make install it:

	tar vxjf xf-spf-xx.tar.bz2
	cd xf-spf-xx
	make
	make install
	make clean

This program will be installed as /var/qmail/bin/xf-spf

But before installing, remember it needs libspf2. If you are on FreeBSD, 
install mail/libspf2 before building xf-spf:

	cd /usr/ports/mail/libspf2
	make install clean

Or install libspf2 your way.

5. Configure xf-spf usage on qmail-smtpd's SMTPEXTFORK patch:

Add /var/qmail/bin/xf-spf to the appropriated enviroment variable:

	echo /var/qmail/bin/xf-spf > /var/service/smtpd/env/SMTPEXTFORK

Or use it with tcprules:

	:allow,SMTPEXTFORK="/var/qmail/bin/xf-spf"

Remember that more than one program can be used with SMTPEXTFORK patch. If
you already use any other, add xf-spf separated by comma:

	:allow,SMTPEXTFORK="/var/qmail/bin/xf-spf,/some/other/prog"

Or

	echo "/some/other/prog,/var/qmail/bin/xf-spf" \
		> /var/service/smtpd/env/SMTPEXTFORK

Please, note that, according to RFC-4408 SMTP code 550 should be used to reject
the e-mail message; xf-spf's default behavior tells qmail-smtpd with 
SMTPEXTFORK feature to use this code, so you are heavily encouraged to customize
the message 550 code will print with SMTPEXTFORK:

	echo "SPF check does not designate your IP as permitted sender, \
	see http://www.openspf.org/howworks.html" > \
					/var/service/smtpd/env/550SMTPEXTFORK

Finally, set SPFBEHAVIOR enviroment; for testing purposes set it as 1, so you
can follow /var/log/maillog's entries. For production, the minimum interesting
value for SPFBEHAVIOR is 3. Set it accordingly:

	echo 3 > /var/service/smtpd/env/SPFBEHAVIOR

Remember you can always set SPFBEHAVIOR and 550SMTPEXTFORK with tcprules(1).

Restart qmail-smtpd service with svc -k /var/service/smtpd or your
own way.

6. Good Luck!

Good Luck with xf-spf, a customized SPF checker for qmail to be used with
SMTPEXTFORM patch, used and approved by a number of FreeBSD Brasil LTDA's
customers.

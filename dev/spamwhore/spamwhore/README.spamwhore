1. What is spamwhore?

It is a maildrop filter program, to be used in Delivery Mode. It is intended
to be used from dot-qmail(5) files, both user-defined .qmail on vpopmail and
qmail-ldap, as well as .qmail-default on vpopmail, for entire domain filtering.

spamwhore is simple and customizable filtering script

Currently, only vpopmail is completly supported. Qmail-LDAP work is on the way,
but I did not finish it because our Qmail-LDAP customers preffer to use some
other approaches.

spamwhore features include:

	- per-user .qmail filtering
	- domain-wide .qmail-default filtering
	- runs spamc (spamassassin client) to classify spam
	- allows spamc running to be turned off on a per-user basis
	- can be configured to deliver SPAM to .Spam box (per-user configuration)
	- can be configured to automatically discard messages if SPAM HITS is
	  above a certain value (per-user configuration)
	- Keeps SPAM statistics (per-user)
	- Keeps discarded SPAM individual statistics (per-user)

1. Install Instructions for SpamWhore

This is a maildrop filter program. It means you need maildrop. Version 2.x is
required. Under FreeBSD install it from the Ports Collection:

	/usr/ports/mail/maildrop

Type
	# make

It will install spamwhore and the needed subscribeIMAP.sh script on
${PREFIX}/vpopmail/bin/, and create /var/log/maildrop-spamwhore.log with
appropriated permissions.

2. Deinstalling

Just type:
	# make deinstall


3. Configuring

$VHOME is the user´s HOME, obtained from vpopmail with

	vuserinfo -d user@domain

spamwhore expects to find $VHOME/spamwhore.conf everytime it runs. If it
does not find, it will create this file with default settings. So, the
very first thing you will want to do is edit spamwhore after it is
installed, and look for the commented following block:

	# DEFAULT SETTINGS for spamwhore.conf

Read it out, and uncomment/adjust the desired values.

$VHOME/spamwhore.conf is expected to have the following variables:

- DESCARTA_PTS: when SPAM hits is higher than DESCARTA_PTS, spamwhore will
  discard the message without delivering it.

- SPAMC_DISABLED: spamwhore won´t run spamc (useful if you are running spamc
  from another place, say, a QMAILQUEUE program or vdelivermail, and still
  want to use spamwhore to do selective filtering of Spambox and discarding
  SPAM based on hits)

- TO_SPAMBOX: if this var exists, spamwhore will move SPAM with hits lower
  than DESCARTA_PTS to $VHOME/Maildir/.$TO_SPAMBOX, which usually should be
  "Spam".

Thats all you need to know. spamwhore is a simple filtering and customizeble
filtering script. Feel invited to read and change it.

3. Good Luck!
